# iroh ping

A very simple iroh protocol for pinging a remote node. It's a high level example & easy starting point for new projects.

Walk through the quickstart examples in the [Documentation Website](https://docs.iroh.computer/quickstart).

## This is not the "real" ping

Iroh has all sorts of internal ping-type messages, this is a high level demo of a protocol, and in no way necessary for iroh's normal operation.
